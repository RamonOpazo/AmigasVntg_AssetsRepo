# The action potential
#MCB80_1x #neurophysiology #actionPotential

The action potential is the rapid depolarization followed by rapid repolarization of a specific location in the membrane of cells. It comprises several phases mediated by particular voltage-gated ion channels.

1. **Resting phase**. The membrane is at the resting potential (-70mV).
2. **Stimulation**. The membrane experiences a depolarizing stimulus.
3. **Rising phase**. If the stimulus reaches a certain threshold (-55 mV) it will start a positive feedback loop of opening voltage-gated $Na^+$ channels and further depolarization of the membrane.
4. **Falling phase**. After reaching its maximum (about +40 mV), the action potential reverts and the repolarization of the membrane occurs mediated by the opening of the voltage-gated $K^+$ channels and the inactivation of the voltage-gated $Na^+$ channels.
5. **Undershoot**. The repolarization stops at a more hyperpolarized state than in the resting state (about -90 mV).
6. **Recovery**. All voltage-gated channels close and the refractory period disallows for a time the firing of new action potentials. The membrane potential readjust slowly to the previous resting potential.

![Phases of the action potential. It starts at the resting phase (-70 mV). Stimuli depolarize the membrane reaching the threshold (-55 mV) and firing the rising phase. After reaching its maximum (+40 mV), the action potential drops the voltage repolarizing the membrane in the falling phase. The repolarization undershoots (-90 mV). The membrane potential recovers the resting potential voltage.](../img/74657011e31baa6007730459a36d65f6.png)
