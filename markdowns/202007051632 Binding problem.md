An interesting question arises from the intersection of neuroscience, cognitive science and philosophy of mind. How is the information cognitively isolated and integrated? This is called the **binding problem**. the binding problem is yet to be resolved, but it can be divided into two subproblems.

1. **Segregation problem (BP1)**, which is the problem of how is the information isolated. In other words, how the brain segregates elements in complex patterns of sensory input so they are allocated to _discrete objects_.
2. **Combination problem (BP2)**, which is the problem of how is the information integrated as to make sense. In other words, how objects, background and abstract features are combined into a _single experience_.
