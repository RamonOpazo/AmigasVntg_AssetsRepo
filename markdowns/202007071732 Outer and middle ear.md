The ear is divided in three major parts: _outer_, _middle_ and _inner_ ear. The structures involved in each part allow for specific functions that not only allow for hearing perception but also protection of the hearing organ.

The **outer ear** is composed of three subparts:

1. The **pinna** is the most external structure made up of cartilage and skin and is mostly fixed. Lateral localization of sound is determined by the position of the pinna, up/down localization is determined by the shape of the pinna. All this allows for _triangulation_ of sound source.
2. The **external auditory meatus** or auditory canal is structure that let sound enters the skull and come into contact with the tympanic membrane.
3. The **tympanic membrane** or eardrum is a membrane that vibrates at the same frequency as the sound, and this mechanical movement is transferred to internal structures.

The **middle ear** receives the mechanical movement from the eardrum. It is composed of three interconnected bones called **ossicles**, which are: the **malleus** (hammer), **incus** (anvil) and **stapes** (stirrup). The malleus is attached to the eardrum and the anvil to a second membrane named the **oval window** which connects with the inner ear.

The middle ear achieves two tasks:

- It **amplifies** signals. Due to the change of phase between the air of sound waves and the liquid inside the inner ear part of the vibration gets reflected. In order to counteract and amplify soft sounds the ossicles rises the signal about 30 dB.
- It **protects** from damaging sounds through the action of muscles that diminish the amplitude of the signal when needed.

A situation in which there is no transmission of sound to the inner ear is called a **conductive hearing loss**. This can be caused simply by sticking ones finger to ones ear, disruption of the ossicles, etc. Mostly happening at outer and middle ear level, it can also be produced by some alterations in the inner ear. This type of hearing loss can be treated with auditory aids.
