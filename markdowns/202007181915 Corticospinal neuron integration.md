THe **distal motor task** is an experiment in which a trained monkey makes an stereotyped movement of the distal muscle groups, for example, left wrist flexion, and the neural activity of the motor cortex (M1) is mapped. This experiment gives indication about probable **causality** between topographical neural activity and behavior.

The _findings_ and _conclusions_ of the experiment can be resumed in the following:

1. _Finding_: Different motor neurons fire when flexing vs extending. _Conclusion_: upper motor neurons are sensitive to direction of movement.
2. _Finding_: There us a delay between activity in the motor cortex and activity in the wrist. _Conclusion_: motor cortex is activated before muscles, not in response to them.
3. _Finding_: corticospinal activity scales with force required. _Conclusion_: upper motor neurons can tune their firing to the amount of force needed.
4. _Finding_: specific actions produce reliable patterns of activity. _Conclusion_: M1 neurons do not habituate. This remain true no matter the amount of activity and repetition.

In other words, each upper motor neuron conveys information about _direction_, _force_, _amplitud_ and _sequence_, although the latter function involves _patterns_ of M1 activation.

Finally, other parts of the brain exert _modulatory_ input to the motor cortex. These areas are the _cerebellum_ and the _basal ganglia_.
