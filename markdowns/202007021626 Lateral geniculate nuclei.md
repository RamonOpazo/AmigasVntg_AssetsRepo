The lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN) receives input from the retina and _predominantly_ (about 80%) the _visual cortex_. This thalamocortical loop is visible in the EEG.

The ipsilateral and contralateral axons from the retina that are contained in the optic tract project into three distinct layers each, _six in total_. The cellular organization of these layers is distinctive.

- The two most ventral layers have larger neurons, the **magnocellular** or **m–type neurons**, which have large _center–surround_ receptive fields for movement perception.
- The four most dorsal layers have smaller neurons, the **parvocellular** or **p–type neurons** which have a smaller _center–surround_ receptive field. They show persistent firing in response to object shape.
- In between these layers there are a third group of neurons, the **koniocellular neurons** that are involved in representing color information.
