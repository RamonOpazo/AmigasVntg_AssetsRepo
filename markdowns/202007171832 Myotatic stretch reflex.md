# Myotatic stretch reflex
#MCB80_3x #movement #reflex #model

The myotatic stretch reflex is a type of _intrinsic spinal circuit_. It starts in the _muscle spindle_, a type of propioceptor that senses the stretching of the muscle they belong to, synapses in the spinal cord once with an $\alpha$ motor neuron which innervates the same muscle.

The **muscle spindle** is a structure located deep inside a particular muscle, composed of six to eight thin muscle fibers called **intrafusal muscle fibers**. This intrafusal muscle fibers don’t contribute to the muscle movement (extrafusal muscle fibers do), but report muscle _length_ and _rate of change_ in length to the sensory dendrites (**primary afferents**) coming from the _dorsal root ganglion cell_. This actual perception is evoked by the opening of _mechanically–gated ion channels_ in the wrapped sensory dendrites. The axons of the dorsal root ganglion cell synapse with the $\alpha$ motor neuron in the spinal cord which innervates, normally, the _same muscle_ that generated the signal, causing it to contract, thus _maintaining_ the length of the muscle. The whole process takes about _1 ms_,  involves only **one synapse**, and the time spent at the synapse is about _0.5 to 0.9 ms_. The synaptic delay determines the speed of the reflex in the end.

Notwithstanding the myotatic reflex, the intrafusal muscle fibers are still able to report changes in length of the muscle, even after contraction of the muscle. This should not be possible due to the minimal participation in contraction that this fibers have, thus making them loose and unable to sense. In order to counteract this deficit, a second group of dendrite called **secondary afferents** wrap around the ends of the muscle spindle and make synapse in the spinal cord to **gamma motor neurons**, which in turn innervate the intrafusal muscle fibers, making them contract in unison with the rest of the muscle.
