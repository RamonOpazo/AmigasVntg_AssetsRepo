The axons that leave the retina bundle into different neural pathways, collectively named **retinofugal projections**. The **retinotectal projection** is formed by a significant subset of axons, it goes from the _retina_ to the _tectum_ (or superior colliculus) in the brainstem. It is involved in _orienting_ to stimuli of the environment. There is an **accessory optic system**, formed by axons that travel from the _retina_ to a set of _small nuclei_ involved in involuntary reflexes (e.g. the optic kinetic reflex). It maintains a crisp image even in moving conditions. Finally, the projections travel to the **thalamus**, and further projections go to the **cerebral cortex**, where the conscious perception of visual information happens.

The retinofugal projections consist of five major structures, which in order from the retina area: 1) the _optic nerve_, 2) the _optic chiasma_, 3) the _optic tract_, 4) the _lateral geniculate nucleus_ in the thalamus, and 5) the _optic radiation_.

The **optic nerve** are the bundle of axons leaving the retina. The information from the right visual field is projected in the cortex of the left brain hemisphere and vice versa. This crossing of information affects only the external visual field, and happens in the **optic chiasma**. This is called a _decussation_. The bundles after the decussation are called **optic tract**. The tracts transmit the information of either the right or left visual field, and project into the thalamic **lateral geniculate nuclei** (LGN). Finally, the path continues through the **optic radiation** to the right and left visual cortex.
