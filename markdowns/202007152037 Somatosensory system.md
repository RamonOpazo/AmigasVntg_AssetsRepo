What we identify as the sense of touch is composed by a series of related inputs: pressure, stretch, vibration and  temperature. A better naming convention is to define it as the **somatosensory system**.

In order to be able to compose the aforementioned sensations, there are several different types of receptors, each responding to specific stimuli: _thermoreceptors_, _photoreceptors_, _mechanoreceptors_ and _chemoreceptors_.

The **sensory modalities** of the system are: _propioception_ which allows for movement perception, _mechanoreception_ which respond to touch proper, _thermoreception_ for temperature and _nociception_ for pain.

Though the somatosensory system have inputs not only in the skin, but also in the joints, muscles, vasa, etc, the **cutaneous sensations** (i.e. touch, pressure, heat, cold and pain) are the one described.

1. **Heat, cold and pain**: sensed by naked nerve endings in the skin. The receptor involved is called _transient receptor potential (TRP) channels_, which are non–selective cation channels that depolarize the neuron. This receptors can sense temperature changes, and can be also activated by chemicals which mimic the thermal sensation (e.g. chili pepper for hot, or menthol for cold). There are more cold–sensing receptors than heat ones. The latter are alos found deeper in the skin.
2. **Nociception**: mediated by nociceptors via free nerve endings that respond to tissue damage. Their _firing frequency_ determines the _intensity_ of the pain.
3. **Touch**: mediated by mechanoreceptors, which can be found in _hairy_ and _hairless_ (glabrous) skin. _Hairless skin_ contains four type of mechanoreceptors: Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner’s corpuscles, Merkel’s disc and Ruffini endings. In _hairy skin_, naked nerve endings are found wrapped around the hair follicle which allows to sense distortion of the hair.

The somatosensory pathway is divided according to the signal transmitted. The **dorsal column pathway** carries propio– and mechanoreceptor signals. The **Spinothalamic tract** carries nociceptor and thermoreceptor signals. Either pathway is composed of three neurons:

1. The **primary neuron** always has its soma in the **dorsal root ganglion** of the spinal nerve.
2. The **secondary neuron** has its soma depending on the pathway followed. The _dorsal column pathway_ presents the soma of the second neuron in the _medulla oblongata_, whereas the _spinothalamic tract_ has its soma in the _spinal cord_. In either case, the axon always crosses to the opposite side of the body.
3. The **tertiary neuron** can be found in the thalamus or cerebellum. In the case of touch and certain types of pain, the tertiary neuron has the cell body in the thalamus, ending in the _postcentral gyrus_ of the parietal lobe where the **primary somatosensory cortex (S1)** resides.

Other differences concern myelination. Pain is conducted by slow, thin, _unmyelinated_ neurons. Casual touch is conducted by faster, thicker, myelinated neurons.

The mapping of S1 follows a two dimensional topographic organization of the skin, named **somatotropic**. This mapping is represented by the somatosensory homunculus.
