Katz (from the GHK equation) studied the neuromuscular joint (NMJ). He observed the action potential on the postsynaptic terminal after stimulating the presynaptic terminal. A side note on terminology:

- **Excitatory post–synaptic potential (EPSP)**. Potentials registered in the postsynaptic terminal which are more likely to produce an action potential due to the fact that they are close to threshold.
- **Inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP)**. Potentials registered in the postsynaptic terminal which produce a lower likelihood of firing an action potential because of their hyperpolarized nature.
- **End–plate potential (EPP)**. This are the potentials registered in the muscle (the postsynaptic terminal) in the NMJ.
- **mini EPP (mEPP)**. Tiny potentials registered in the postsynaptic terminal of the NMJ that occurs without a presynaptic stimulation, and that are smaller than normal EPPs.

Katz observed that mEPPs appeared while no stimulus was applied to the presynaptic terminal. This mEPPs where directly proportional to the concentration of $Ca^{+2}$ in the environment of the NMJ. Not only that, but he also noticed that the EPP amplitude was a multiple of the amplitude of the mEPPs, which in turn grew on augmenting the concentration of extracellular $Ca^{+2}$.

![EPP and mEPPs. EPPs amplitude exist in multiples of mEPPs amplitude, which suggested the quantization of neurotransmitters released to the synaptic cleft.](../img/9b2614d851452d9282a4f4b0383bfc8f.png)

This suggested that calcium ions entered the cell at the presynaptic terminal and promoted the liberation of _quantized amount of neurotransmitters_. Nowadays, we know that neurotransmitters are stored in vesicles, and that the depolarization of the presynaptic terminal opens voltage-gated calcium channels, letting calcium into the cell which in turn promotes the adhesion of vesicles full of neurotransmitters to the axon's membrane, releasing them into the synaptic cleft where they stimulate receptors on the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron.

Interestingly, the quantization can be only observed at low $[Ca^{+2}]$. On more physiological concentrations the quantization is obscured by the nature of greater numbers.
