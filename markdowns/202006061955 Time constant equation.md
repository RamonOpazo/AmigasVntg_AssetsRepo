The time constant is the amount of time needed for the membrane to charge up to 63% of its final charge value in response to a change in potential. The time constant is the product of the **membrane's resistance** and **capacitance**. As such, the greater either of the variables, the greater the time constant, thus the more sluggish the neuron. On the contrary, the lesser the variables, the snappier the neuron.

The constant is described by the following equation.

$$
\displaystyle \tau = R_{membrane} * C_{membrane}
$$

> where $\tau$ is the time constant in seconds, $R_{membrane}$ is the membrane's resistance in $\Omega*cm$, and $C_{membrane}$ is the membrane's capacitance in $F$.
> $F$: farad ($C/V$, coulomb divided by volt).

The **capacitance** (ability to store charge) of a given capacitor changes in relation to _thickness_ and _type of material_. The greater the thickness, the lower the capacitance, and vice versa. In the cell's membrane (the dielectric part of the capacitor) the material remains constant, but the thickness varies through myelination. Thicker axons produce lower capacitance, which in turn produce a smaller time constant and so faster transmission of the charge.

In the case of **resistance**, the greater its value, the less likely will ions pass through the membrane, so it becomes more difficult (and time consuming) for the cell to produce a change in the charge. A relative abundance of ion channels produces a lower resistance, which in turn determines a smaller time constant and faster charge transmission. As a note, this equation is _valid for Resistor–Capacitor circuits (RC circuits)_.

The time constant constitute a passive property of the membrane due to the same reasons as the length constant.
