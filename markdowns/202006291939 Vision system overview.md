# Vision system overview

The vision is a complex sensory system that is organized in _parallel_ as well as _sequential_ flows of information. It originates with the reception of photons in the retina, traveling through the optic nerve to the thalamus, and finally to the visual cortex.

Light has a double nature, behaving both as _particle_ and as _waive_ (**wave–particle duality**). Depending on its wavelength we can broadly classify the electromagnetic spectrum in:

 - **Infrared**, starting at 700 nm.
 - **Ultraviolet**, under 390 nm.
 - **Visible**, between 700 and 390 nm.

The **energy** of electromagnetic radiation is _directly_ proportional to its _frequency_ ($v$ in the diagram), and thus _inversely_ proportional to its _wavelength_ ($\lambda$), as stated in Einstein’s **photoelectric equation** (a blue photon carries more energy than a red one). Formally, one can express this relationship as follows.

$$
\displaystyle
f = \frac{E}{h},\quad \textrm{or} \quad E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
$$

> where $f$ is the frequency, $E$ is energy, $h$ is the Planck’s constant, $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, and $\lambda$ is the frequency.

The eye captures light and focalizes it into the retina by means of lenses (the lens and the cornea). In the retina there are several layers organized in an **inside out** fashion, and can be simplified in three components: a) _photoreception_ by specialized cells [§202006292034 ─ Phototransduction], b) _internal transmission_ by bipolar cells, and c) _output_ by ganglion cells which ultimately form the optic nerve.
