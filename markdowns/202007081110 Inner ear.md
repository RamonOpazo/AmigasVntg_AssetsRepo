# Inner ear
#MCB80_3x #anatomy #model #perception

The inner ear is a bony structure called **labyrinth**, which is composed of three parts: the _vestibule_, the _semicircular canals_, and the _cochlea_. The vestibule and semicircular canals are part of the vestibular system, whereas the cochlea is part of the auditory system.

The cochlea transform sound waves into neural activity. It is structured in the shape of a coiled–in tube whose diameter is diminishing in length. This main tube consist of three liquid filled tubes, from top to bottom: the _scala vestibuli_, _scala media_ and _scala tympani_. The two membranes that separate this tubes are named, from top to bottom: _Reissner’s membrane_ and the _basilar membrane_. The organ of audition named the **organ of Corti** rest on top of the basilar membrane and is lined on top by the _tectorial membrane_.

Both the scala vestibuli and scala tympani are filled with **perilymph**, a liquid that has an ionic composition similar to the NSF (i.e. with higher sodium concentration and lower potassium concentration compared to the intracellular). In turn, the scala media is filled with **endolymph** whose composition is the opposite (high potassium and low sodium concentration). This difference in ionic concentration between fluids is produced by active transport at an structure named **stria vascularis**. The result is an electrical potential, the **endocochlear potential** [§202007081036 ─ Endocochlear potential].

Once the oval window is pushed by the foot of the stapes, the perilymph is displaced, causing the basilar membrane to vibrate. This, in turn causes a relative movement in relation to the tectorial membrane, producing a shearing force on the **hair cells** of the organ of Corti. Is this shearing force that opens **mechanically–gated ion channels** in the hair cell, causing its hyper or depolarization depending on the direction of the movement. The hair cells have 60 or so **stereocilia** on the apical face facing the tectorial membrane.

Normally, there are a 10% of cells in a depolarized state when no sound is perceived. The tilting of the stereocilia in the direction of their **tall edge** produce _depolarization_ of the remaining hair cells, whereas the tilting in the opposite direction produce the _hyperpolarization_ of the 10% depolarized cells.

Finally, the depolarization of hair cells causes release of neurotransmitters which in turn cause the depolarization of the **spiral ganglion**. The signal is then transported by the **auditory nerve** to the brainstem, and then relayed to the thalamus and cortex.
