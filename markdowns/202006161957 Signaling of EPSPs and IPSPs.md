# Signaling of EPSPs and IPSPs

As seen before, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) and their counterpart inhibitory ones (IPSP) are changes in the membrane of the postsynaptic terminal that alter the probability at which an action potential can be triggered in the membrane of the soma of a neuron.

The _temporal sum_ of continuous EPSPs as well as the _spatial sum_ of coetaneous EPSPs (typically explained by $Na^{+}$ influx) can elevate the membrane's charge just enough to produce the opening of voltage–gated sodium channels at the axon hillock, event that determines the production of an action potential in that given neuron.

In contrast, _IPSPs_ (typically produced by $Cl^{-}$ influx, but also because of potassium and calcium channels) normally anchor the membrane potential at around the value of the resting potential, thus making it harder for the EPSPs to reach the threshold.
