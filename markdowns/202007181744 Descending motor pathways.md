# Descending motor pathways
#MCB80_3x #movement #neuralnetwork #model

Motor input is originated not only in the spinal cord, but in two major areas: the motor cortex and the brainstem. Starting from this areas, two descending motor pathways are defined.

**Dorsolateral pathway**. The input is controled by the _brain cortex_ and the _midbrain_, descending through the most dorsolateral part of the white matter of the spinal cord. This pathway controls _fine voluntary distal movement_. Due to the fact that the extremities are located closer to the cervical and lumbosacral areas of the column, there exist a _widening_ of the spinal cord at these levels, which represent the higher concentration of descending inputs, that is, axons that end on specific groups of lower motor neurons in the spinal cord’s _ventral horn_.

**Ventromedial pathway**. The inputs form this pathway are controlled by several incleus in the _brain stem_, descending through the most ventromedial part of the white matter of the spinal cord. The ventromedial pathway controls _the proximal and midline muscles_, which are essential for for generating autonomic functions of maintaining the posture and generating locomotion.

In both cases the signal **decussates**. It also comes into contact with an **interneuron** and a **lower motor neuron**. The dorsolateral pathway decussates at the level of the _medulla oblongata_. Ventromedial pathway fibers do decussate but at the _level of the spinal cord_ where they innervate the lower motor neuron.

Isolated lesions of the _dorsolateral pathway_ produce a loss of fine movement control, but a preserved function of posture control. In the case of isolated damage of the _anteromedial pathway_, the deficit is the opposite.
