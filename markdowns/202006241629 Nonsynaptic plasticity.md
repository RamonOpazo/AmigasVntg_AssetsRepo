# Nonsynaptic plasticity

Whenever changes occur in any place of the neuron other than the synapses (e.g. soma, axon and dendrites) we called this changes **nonsynaptic plasticity**. This changes typically involve the modification of ion channel function.

Due to the fact that this changes are not locally restricted, they affect the **overall integration** of _excitatory_ and _inhibitory_ postsynaptic potentials, affecting the **intrinsic excitability** of the postsynaptic neuron.

The idea behind nonsynaptic plasticity is to maintain excitability of the postsynaptic neuron within some desired range, thus, giving this type of processes another name: **homeostatic mechanisms**. The desired range ensures a functioning level that is: a) **non deleterious** to the neuron and the system, and b) **enough for participation** within the network, as if to not become a wasteful resource.
