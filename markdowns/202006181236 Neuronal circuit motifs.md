# Neuronal circuit motifs
#MCB80_2x #neuralNetwork #neurophysiology #model

Neural integration and synaptic efficacy describe the building blocks of neural networks. These neural networks organize themselves in three major motifs:

1. **Convergence**. In which many neurons integrate their inputs into one single neuron.
2. **Divergence**. Where one neuron distributes its input into many downstream neurons.
3. **Recurrence**. That is, the ping-ponging of signals from one neuron (or group of neurons) to another one.

The **myotatic reflex** (also called the stretch reflex) shows convergence and divergence in its route. The reflex starts when the spindle organ of a muscle senses a stretch, firing a signal that travels through the _dorsal root ganglion neuron_ to an alpha neuron in the muscle. Because normally the stretching happens in several muscle fibers, all of this inputs get _converged_ into the _alpha motor neuron_ down the stream to start contraction of opposing muscles so that the net movement of the muscle is almost zero. This process involves the recruiting of many such neurons, thus providing an example of _divergence_.

**Central pattern generators (CPGs)** are neural networks that use recurrence (and combination of all the motifs actually) to produce rhythmic patterned outputs, even in the absence of ongoing sensory inputs. They are typically found in many kinds of movement patterns such as swimming in mollusks, peristalsis and even complex motor sequences like walking.
