In the neuromuscular junction, EPSPs, called sometimes end plates potentials (EPPs), are produced by the release of acethylcholine. The postsynaptic receptor, called the **nicotinic acethylcholine receptor (nAchR)**, is a **ligand–gated ion channel**. It's conformed by five subunits: _two alpha and one beta, gamma and delta subunits_, all of which arrange producing a channel like structure that is closed in its normal state. Each subunit has 4 transmembrane domains (M1 to M4), out of which M2 is always presented to the lumen of the channel forming the _central pore of the channel_. M2 suffers a conformational change that allows for the passage of water and ions when, and only when, _both alpha subunits bind their ligand_ (acethylcholine).

This ionotropic receptor is referred to as a _promiscuous cation channel_ because of the fact that it is permeable to cations in general. The funnel–like structure it presents to the extracellular face of the membrane has an abundance of negatively charged amino acids that attract positively charged ions. The central pore is also rich in negatively charged amino acids.

Once opened, the channel allows the entrance of sodium ions which depolarize the membrane, but also the exit of potassium ones with the subsequent polarization. As long as the channel remains opened the membrane will reach the _reversal potential_ defined by this two ions, which is the average sum of their Nernst potentials.

$$
\displaystyle
\begin{aligned}
\textrm{nAchR reversal potential} &= (E_{Na} + E_{K}) / 2 \\
  &= (60 mV - 80 mV)/2 \\
  &= -10 mV \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Subsequently, the inactivation in time of the nAchRs due to acethylcholine capture in the synaptic cleft allow for the final repolarization of the membrane. Nevertheless, some toxins and chemical compounds take advantage of this reversal potential state thus inhibiting new depolarization of the membrane. Such is the case of _succinylcholine_ that, in being similar to acethylcholine, activates the nAchRs, but is not subsequently sequestered, producing a hypotonic or even complete loss of function of the affected terminals.

Acethylcholine is the most prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter of the peripheral nervous system.
