How is plasticity then formed? In 1949, the Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb _postulated_ that: given a pair of neurons A and B, whenever a repeated or constant firing of neuron A (even because of close proximity of axon) elicits a firing in neuron B, there occurs a metabolic change in neuron A such that increases it efficacy in firing neuron B. This postulate is named **Hebb's rule** (or Hebb's theory), also called **cell assembly theory**.

In other words:

- Neurons that fire together wire together.
- Neurons out of sync lose their link.

Pavlovian conditioning learning is thus explained by this model of neural plasticity. In such case, the constant ringing of the bell paired with the presentation of food elicits salivation by a dog. This is, the dog's neurons regarding bell recognition resulted in an increase in efficacy to excite the ones regarding preparation for food consumption (thus salivation).

Hebb's rule is often generalized as follows:

$$
\displaystyle \Delta w_{i} = \eta x_{i} y
$$

> where the change in the $i$th synaptic weight $w_{i}$ is equal to a learning rate $\eta$ times the $i$th input $x_{i}$ times the postsynaptic response $y$.

$$
\displaystyle y = \sum_{j} {w_{j} x_{j}}
$$

> for the case of a linear neuron, where both the learning rate and the input weights are considered to be 1.
