Ohm's law explains the relation between **current**, **resistance** and **voltage** in a given circuit. Current is directly proportional to the voltage difference between two points, and inversely proportional to resistance. Doubling, for example, the resistance while maintaining the voltage produces a cut in half of the current.

$$
\displaystyle I = \frac{V}{R}
$$

> where $I$ is current measured in amperes ($A$), $V$ is voltage in volts ($V$) and $R$ is resistance in ohms ($\Omega$).

$$
\displaystyle 
I = \frac{dC}{dt}
$$

> current is simply the change in charge over time.

It is worth noting that this relation is an empirical observation, and applies to the vast majority of materials over many orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, some materials do not obey this law and are called non–ohmic.
