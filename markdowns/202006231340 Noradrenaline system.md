# Noradrenaline system
#MCB80_2x #neurophysiology #receptors #model

Noradrenaline is secreted by a very small number of neurons, about 1500 in each side of the brainstem, in a place called the **locus coeruleus** in the lateral segmental field. Nevertheless, adrenergic receptors are found in many parts of the brain and in the peripheral nervous system.

The _effects_ of the noradrenergic system includes: modulation of general arousal, modulation of the fight or flight response, and activation of reward.
