#pharmacology #receptors

The allosteric modulation of a given receptor is the change in the receptor's response to a given stimulus that is produced by the binding of **allosteric modulators** to sites different to the ones endogenous agonists bind to. The resulting modulation can increase, maintain or decrease the response. An increase in known as **positive modulation**, whereas a decrease is called a **negative modulation**.
