# Cholinergic system
#MCB80_2x #neurophysiology #receptors #model

Acethylcholine is used as a _neuromodulator in the central nervous system_. It arises form a relatively small number of cells, and binds to the **M1 receptors** in many different areas such as: neocortex, hippocampus, brainstem and deep nuclei. The _effects_ of the cholinergic system comprises: muscle and motor control, learning, short–term memory, and general arousal. There are also cholinergic receptors in the parasympathetic system.

**Scopolamine** is an anticholinergic drug used to treat gastrointestinal spasms, but due to the fact that is not selective, it can produce anterograde amnesia. Scopolamine can also produce a victim to enter a dissociative state, unable to form plans and exercise free will.
