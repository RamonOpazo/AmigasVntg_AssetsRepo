Voluntary movement is initiated at the cortex level. Here, there are three major sites from which movements of different degrees of complexities are created.

![Broadmann areas. Motor integration occurs primarily in Brodmann areas 4, 6 and 7.](../img/38d5713b3645140c1ae4dadcc8029a6d.png)

The **primary motor cortex (M1)**, located anterior and along the central sulcus, in the dorsal part of the frontal lobe. This area corresponds to _Brodmann area 4_ (§202007091430 ─ Brodmann areas of the cortex). This area of the cortex is arranged in the classical 6 layers, from which the classic pyramidal _upper motor neurons_ arise from layer 5. M1 controls _specific_ muscle movement, and is mapped in a _somatotopic fashion_, with _overrepresentation_ of motor areas that need finer control such as the hand and the face.

The **premotor cortex**, situated just anterior to M1, corresponding to _Brodmann area 6_, generates complex multi muscle movements such as the rotation of an entire limb through the activation of particular M1 neurons.

The **posterior parietal cortex**, located posterior to M1 towards the occipital lobe, and corresponding to _Brodmann area 7_. Its role is to allow for movement planning, taking into account the location of the body in space and the location of other objects with which one might to interact.

It is important to recognize that there is _limited redundancy_ in the motor cortex, allowing for partial or even total compensation in cases of small lesions. Incredibly, experiments in mice showed that total motor cortex removal can spare complex _learned motor behaviors_, suggesting that, at least in some species, other motor pathways may be able to carry complex motor behavior (as in the case of the _striatum_).
