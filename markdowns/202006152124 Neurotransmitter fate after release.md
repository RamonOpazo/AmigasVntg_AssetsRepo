# Neurotransmitter fate after release
#MCB80_2x #neurophysiology #synapse

After the release of a neurotransmitter molecule to the synaptic cleft it can have one of five fates:

1. **Binding to the postsynaptic receptor**. In this case, the molecule traverse the whole distance of the cleft (between 20 to 40 nm) in a very short period of time (about 1 µs) traveling at about 0.05 mph (0.08 kph). The diffusion out of the synaptic cleft takes approximately 1 ms due to the huge area coverage versus width distance of the cleft.
2. **Reabsorption in the postsynaptic cell**. Not only free neurotransmitter molecules can be resorbed but also whole neurotransmitter–receptor complexes as well.
3. **Cleavage**. Done by specific enzymes in the synaptic cleft, like in the case of _acethylcholinesterase_ which cleaves _acethylcholine_.
4. **Transport**. Specific proteins on the surface of glia can bind to free neurotransmitters and take them away. It can even happen inside the synaptic cleft.
5. **Combination of the above mechanisms**. Like in the _acethylcholine_ case, where the molecule is first broken down by the aforementioned acethylcholinesterase enzyme, releasing _choline_ which in turn is taken up by the _presynaptic_ nerve terminal.

All this is done to ensure that the synaptic transmission is produced exactly at and only at a specific time. Otherwise, remaining neurotransmitters could bind and unbind to their receptors producing a continuous signaling in the postsynaptic neuron.
