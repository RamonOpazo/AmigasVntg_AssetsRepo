The physiological translation of electromagnetic energy to chemical energy, and finally electrical impulses in the brain is the result of a process called **phototransduction**. There are two types of photoreceptors in the retina: *rods* and *cones*. Both receptors sense light incoming and produce a chemical response. Rods are 20 times more abundant than cones, and sense light in dim conditions. Cones, in the other hand, sense light in bright conditions and also discriminate color. Rod cells have a peak sensitivity at around 498 nm. The _rod model_ is further analyzed.

Inside Rods there is a protein that performs the interaction with light: **rhodopsin**. This protein is composed of two subunits: 

- **Retinal**, a cofactor derived of vitamin A, which in contact with light experiences a conformational change from _11–cis retinal_ to _all–trans retinal_. Retinal is the ligand to the second subunit.
- **Scotopsin**, a type of opsin, a GPCR which in turn senses the conformational change of retinal and activates _cGMP phosphodiesterase_, an enzyme that depletes cGMP, modulating the inactivation of _cGMP–gated ion channels_. Retinal is permanently ligated to scotopsin, so that this receptor activates immediately whenever a _single photon_ is sensed.

In the **absence of light**, cGMP activates sodium and calcium ion channels which normally _depolarize_ the membrane. When **light is sensed**, rhodopsin depletes cGMP, thus inactivating the channels and producing a _hyperpolarization_. In other words, light stops the production of action potentials from the photoreceptor. This system ensures the cascading effect of second messengers as a mean to amplify single photon signals.

In bright conditions, rod cells are _bleached_, causing them to become inactive.
