# Lower motor neurons
#MCB80_3x #model #movement

There are two type of motor neurons: _upper motor neurons_ project from the cortex, whereas _lower motor neurons_, also called $\alpha$ motor neuron, form the final common pathway for muscle control.

A **motor unit** is the set of muscle fibers and the $\alpha$ motor neuron that innervate them. This neuron usually innervate hundreds up to thousands of muscle fiber. Any muscle consist of muscle fibers from multiple different motor units.

A **motor pool** is the set of motor neurons whose axons control all the muscle fibers of a given single muscle. Motor units belonging to a particular motor pool come in a variety of sizes. This allows for the generation of _different levels of force_, depending on which motor units are recruited. During contraction, smaller motor units are recruited first, and bigger later, thus ensuring _motor control and force_. This is known as the **Henneman’s size principle**.

Most of the $\alpha$ motor neurons have their heads in the **ventral horn** of the spinal cord. From there, they are arranged in three mappings:

1. **Rostro–caudal map**. This is a segmental map from head to tail in four subdivisions that correspond with the vertebral names: _a)_ Cervical motor neurons_ innervate the head and neck, _b)_ thoracic motor neurons innervate the trunk, _c)_ lumbar motor neurons innervate the front of the legs, and _d)_ sacral motor neurons control bag leg muscles, the bladder, bowels and sexual organs. This arrangement is parallel to the muscle that get innervated by the motor neurons. For any given rostro–caudal segment, there are two other mappings in the gray matter of the spinal cord.
2. **Medial–lateral map**. This mapping depends on how far are from the center of the body axis.
3. **Flexo–extensor map**. _Flexor_ muscles are innervated by motor neurons from the upper part of the ventral horn, whereas _extensor_ muscles are innervated by motor neurons from the lower part.

Finally, lower motor neurons receive inputs from three sources:

- Dorsal ganglion root of the sensory system.
- Excitatory and inhibitory spinal interneurons.
- Upper motor neurons projecting directly from motor centers.
