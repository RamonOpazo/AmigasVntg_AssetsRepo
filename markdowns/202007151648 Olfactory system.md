# Olfactory system

Olfaction is encoded in around 1000 genes which are shared by almost all mammals. Some mammals can activate a greater percentage of this genetic pool compared to humans, which can only activate about 60% of them. The rest are functionally _pseudogenes_.

**Odor** is the perception of a given smell, normally conformed by various odorants. **Odorants** are volatile chemicals, most of the time hydrophobic, to which we have receptors against.

Although the availability of different receptors is scarce, humans can distinguish up to a hundred thousand odors. This ability is explained by the way olfactory receptors work. There are several theories:

1. **Shape–pattern theory**, states that scent perception depends on the _amount_ of structural fit between an odorant’s receptor shape and the odorant’s shape. As an example, _stereoisomers_ are perceived as completely different odors.
2. **Activity pattern** across variant odor receptors types.
3. **Concentration** of a given odorant, which gives the intensity.
4. **Timing and order** by which and odorant receptor gets activated.

Odorants are inhaled through the nostrils, an analogous of the pinnae in the auditory system. After that, odorants pass the **olfactory cleft**, a place where the main **olfactory epithelium** is located. This epithelium consist of three primary cell types: _supporting cells_, _basal cells_ and _olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs)_. Basal cells are precursors of the OSNs which in turn are bipolar neurons.

ONSs form the **olfactory nerve** at the basal end. They are also covered with a _non–motile cilia_ at the apical end where the receptors are physically found. OSNs require at least seven molecules to activate, and are extremely slow both in transmission as well as in regeneration of signal.

Axons of the OSN pass the cribiform plate of the ethmoid bone, forming the olfactory 
nerve, which is one of the CNS structures that _can be regenerated_. The aforementioned axons pass information to the **mitral cell projections** (second–order neurons) in the **olfactory bulb**. These synapses form spherical glomeruli. Typically, each OSN converges onto two glomeruli, one medial and one lateral. Trauma, disease and aging produce **anosmia**. At age 85, it is estimated that 50% percent of people are effectively anosmic.

After the olfactory bulb, smell information is passed to the **olfactory cortex** and also to the **lymbic system** directly (_amygdala_, _hippocampus_ and the _entorhinal cortex_ in the temporal lobe). The lymbic system is involved in: emotion, memory, behavior and motivation, which explains the close relationship between smell and emotions and memories.

Finally, olfactory information have no primary thalamic processing. Notably, it is processed mainly in the right brain hemisphere, which divorce the primary perception to language integration to some extent, a feature that is even reflected in the lack of linguistic precision and terms about olfaction.
