The hipothalamus is found in all vertebrates brains, sitting below the thalamus and above the brainstem. The main function of the hipothalamus is to **maintain homeostasis** of the body. It achieves this goal by regulating different autonomous and behavioral systems.

Whenever there is an homeostatic unbalance, the hipothalamus mounts a **three–pronged response**: engagement of the _autonomic nervous system (ANS)_, the _endocrine system_, and the _behavioral system_. This response has the aim to rebalance the body to an internal _set point_.

Commands are then sent to: _a)_ the brainstem and the spinal cord to activate the autonomic preganglionic neurons to mount a _flight or fight_, or _rest and digest_ response; _b)_ the basal ganglia and the cortex, in order to motivate homeostatic behavior; and finally _c)_ the pituitary gland, which in turn control hormone release.

## Zettel

In this fashion, the hipothalamus generate hunger, thirst, cold, heat, etc. It even generate the drive for sex, parenting aspects and attachment. Due to the fact that many small hypothalamic nuclei control all this factors, when deregulation in one nuclei happens it’s hard to target and isolate it. In general, hypothalamic intervention produce deregulation of other healthy hypothalamic nuclei (i.e. off–target effects).
