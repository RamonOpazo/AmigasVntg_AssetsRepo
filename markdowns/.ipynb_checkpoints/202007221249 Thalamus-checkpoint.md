description: The thalamus is the largest part of the diencephalon, sitting at the center of the brain, between the cerebral cortex and the midbrain. It receives input from all the sensory receptors except the olfactory system, and also from almost all areas of the cerebral cortex either sensory and nonsensory, the basal ganglia, the cerebellum and the limbic system. It also projects back to the cortex and subcortical structures in reciprocal loops. For these, the thalamus is a relay station but also a place where processing occurs. The main functions of the thalamus are.

The **thalamus** is the largest part of the diencephalon, sitting at the center of the brain, between the cerebral cortex and the midbrain. It receives input from all the sensory receptors _except_ the olfactory system, and also from almost all areas of the cerebral cortex either sensory and nonsensory, the basal ganglia, the cerebellum and the limbic system. It also projects back to the cortex and subcortical structures in _reciprocal loops_. For these, the thalamus is a _relay station_ but also a place where processing occurs. The main functions of the thalamus are:

1. **Relay station**. There are two pathways, downwards from the cerebral cortex, and upwards towards it. Visual information pass through the LGN, whereas auditory information does through the MGN.
2. **Sensory processing**. Sensory signals get modified and then projected to the specific area of the cerebral cortex they belong.
3. **State regulation**. Arousal, or level of awareness, is involved with thalamic process, though still not well understood.

Damage to the thalamus produce a deregulation of awareness level. Loss of function conduce to coma. A thalamic disease named **fatal familial insomnia** produces progressive lethal insomnia due to selective degeneration of thalamic neurons.
