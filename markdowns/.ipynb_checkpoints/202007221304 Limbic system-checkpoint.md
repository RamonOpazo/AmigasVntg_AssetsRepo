Evolutionary classification of the brain is useful to understand part of the functions of each structure:

1. **Protoreptilian brain**.
    - Basal ganglia.
    - Midbrain.
    - Brainstem
2. **Paleomammalian brain**.
    - Limbic system.
3. **Neomammalian brain**.
    - Cerebral cortex.

The limbic system is _composed of_: the olfactory bulbs, hippocampus, amygdala, anterior thalamic nuclei, fornix, septum, habenula, cingulate gyrus, limbic cortex and mid brain areas.

The main function of this system is to create _emotional_ and _motivational_ experiences of the world. It does so controlling feelings like fear, pleasure and adrenaline. The second function of the limbic system is in the _formation of memories_, in particular when they have emotional significance.

The **amygdala** is involved in _emotionally significant memories_. Though is not only reserved for negative experiences (it in fact encodes positively charged memories), negative associations are learned faster and are easy to recall. Input signals to the amygdala come from sensory receptors and the sensory areas of the cortex. In the case of olfactory sensory information, this arrives directly from the olfactory bulb and the cortex.
