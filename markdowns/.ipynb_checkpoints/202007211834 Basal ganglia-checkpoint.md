The **forebrain**, also named prosencephalon, encompasses four main functional systems: the cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia, the thalamus and the limbic system.

The **basal ganglia** interconnects between the neocortex, brainstem, thalamus and other brain areas. Its main function is related to voluntary movement and execution of habitual or automatic actions, as well as emotional and cognitive functions.

Once voluntary movement is generated, the signal gets modulated cognitively by the cortex, projecting down to lower motor neurons. The basal ganglia contributes to modulation unconsciously, thus, it _does not_ initiate voluntary movement.

There are two pathways for basal ganglia modulation, which are necessary in _conjunction_ to have the desired effect:

1. The **direct pathway** send _excitatory_ signals to the cortex through excitation of the thalamus. This produces _increased motor activity_.
2. The **indirect pathway** send _inhibitory_ signals to the thalamus, preventing excitation of the cortex. The net effect is a _decreased motor activity_.

It’s possible that the direct pathway excites motor programms that are _adaptive_ to the task at hand, whereas the indirect pathway suppress the execution of _competing_ programms. Two disease models explain the deregulation of either pathway:

1. In **Parkinson’s disease** there is a loss of the dopaminergic cells of the **substantia nigra**. Dopamine is used to excite the direct pathway and inhibit the indirect one, thus, in Parkinson’s disease there is an increased activity of the _inhibitory indirect pathway_. The symptoms are difficulty to initiate movement and resting tremor.
2. In **Huntington’s disease** there is a selective loss of cells of the **striatum**. There are two types of neurons in the striatum specific for either pathway. In Huntington’s disease the selective loss affects only those neurons involved in the indirect pathway, tipping the balance towards the _excitatory direct pathway_. The symptoms include choreaform movements.
