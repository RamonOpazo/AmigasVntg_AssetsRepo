Cone receptors sense bright light, color, fine details and rapid changes of image. They work in a fashion akin to rods. The opsin in this case is called **photopsin**, a GPCR that is also known as _cone opsin_. Three different photopsins that differs by few amino acids determine the sensitivity to three wavelengths of light.

There are three type of cones:

- **S cones (small)**, sensing blue light. They have a peak sensitivity between 420–440 nm.
- **M cones (medium)**, that sense green light, with a peak sensitivity of 535–550 nm.
- **L cones (large)**, which sense red light and have a peak sensitivity of 565–580 nm.

The sensitivities of the cones _overlap_, allowing for a continuous perception of color from blue to red light. This overlapping also produce another effect: different light spectra can elicit the same combined response of the cones, i.e. the same color. This different spectra that elicit same color perception are called **color metamers**.

The three colored vision is named **trichromat vision**. There are some animals that have a fourth opsin, thus having a tetrachromat vision. Some women also show tetrachromat vision due to the fact that they have slightly different opsins in both copies of the X chromosome. _Deuteranopia_ is produced by the lose of function of the M cones, producing the inability to distinguish between red and green colors (red–green color blindness).
