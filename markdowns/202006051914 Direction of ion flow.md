# Direction of ion flow

There are two aspects to notice when defining the direction a given ion takes given a membrane potential. The first aspect is the **concentration** of a given ion inside and outside the cell. This defines two scenarios:

1. $[ion]_{o} > [ion]_{i}$: diffusion pushes ions to inside the cell.
2. $[ion]_{i} >[ion]_{o}$: diffusion pushes ions to outside the cell.

The greater the concentration $\Delta$ is, the greater will diffusion push. This will happen until the Nernst potential is reached (equilibrium between diffusion and electrostatic force).

The second aspect depends on the **Nernst potential** of a given ion and it relation to the **membrane potential**. Let's consider a Nernst potential for $K^{+}$ of $-80\ mV$. The scenarios are the following:

1. $Membrane\ potential = -40\ mV$: in order to reach equilibrium the membrane potential needs to become more negative until reach the $K^{+}$ Nernst potential. Because the valence is positive, the ions will flow from the inside to the outside of the cell, lowering the membrane potential from $-40$ to $-80\ mV$.
2. $Membrane\ potential = -80\ mV$: here the equilibrium is already reached so there will be no net ion flow.
3. $Membrane\ potential = -120\ mV$: finally, in order to reach equilibrium the membrane potential needs to become more positive. Again, because of the positive valence of potassium the net flow will be from outside to inside the cell, rising the membrane potential from $-120\ mV$ to $-80 mV$.
