There are two types of long term memories. **Declarative memory**, also named _explicit memory_, is the memory of **knowing what**, that is, facts and events, _consciously recalled_ (or declared). It is explicitly stored and retrieved.

**Procedural memory**, also called _implicit memory_, is the memory of **knowing how**. It is an _unconscious memory_ of skills and how to do things, particularly in the use of objects or movements of the body. They are acquired by repetition and practice.

The **hippocampus** is a subcortical area that has two major functions: declarative memory encoding and spatial orientation. Damage in the hippocampus produce _anterograde amnesia_, but implicit procedural memory is preserved, though it must be introduced every time by an external examiner. Long–term potentiation [§202006241050 ─ LTP in depth] has been involved in this phenomenon, enforcing neural patterns that encode for declarative memory.

About the spatial orientation function, cells of the hippocampus and the neighboring _entorhinal cortex_ constitute a kind of _positioning system_ that dynamically maps the environment as one moves around from place to place.

The hippocampus is one of the two places where **neurogenesis** happens in the _adult brain_. Its role is not well understood, it is apparently linked to _memory overwrite_, a process that happens preferentially in babies, who don’t form declarative memories for the first two years.
