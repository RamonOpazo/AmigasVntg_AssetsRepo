The cerebral cortex is a **laminar structure** 2 mm thick normally composed of _six layers_. The portion of the cortex that integrate the visual information is called visual cortex and is located in the _occipital lobe_ (calcarine sulcus), radiating to the circumdating temporal and parietal lobes. 

This primary visual cortex goes by the name **V1** [§202007051427 ─ Visual pathways]. It is also named **striate cortex** based on a striated structure (the stria of Gennari) on layer 4.

Axons from the LGN travel through the optical radiations arriving at V1 in an orderly fashion resembling the _spatial distribution_ of the 2D dimension of the visual field (i.e. the x, y coordinates). This distribution of inputs is called **retinotopy**. The **largest input** occurs in the _spiny stellate neurons_ in layer 4 coming from _magnocellular_ and _parvicellular pathways_. The _koniocellular pathway_ arrives at layers 2 and 3.

Layer 4 have differentiated distribution for the input coming from the left and right eyes, remaining segregated from each other. This structures are called **ocular dominance columns** (ODCs), and span several cortical layers. Monocular deprivation in test subjects produces the degradation of the specific columns that represent the deprived eye, while the columns representing the non deprived eye assume control over the deprived cortical cells.

It is important to notice that **layer 4** have _receptive fields_ akin the ones in bipolar cells and LGN, that is, with a _monocular center–surround_ paradigm. In contrast, **V1** have more _complex receptive fields_ that integrate patterns resembling _edges_, and can be originated from _monocular_ as well as _binocular_ inputs. This response is explained by the transition between ODCs.

Finally, each subsequent area of the visual cortex extract more and more complex information (even contextual and semantic information) from the visual input, starting from V1 and on.
