Though initially thought to be involved uniquely in movement modulation, the cerebellum has a more nuanced signification in the CNS. As such, it is also linked to language, attention and mental imagery. The cerebellum **does not** generate motor activity by itself, but rather modulates it by _environmental context_ and _learning outcomes_. At least _50% of the brain’s total neurons_ belong to the cerebellum.

The cerebellum is organized into tightly folder layers of cortex around a petal–like white matter core. Four nuclei are located at the heart of the white matter core, and correspond to the only places where _output signals_ are sent to the rest of the brain. Two cellular types have specific tasks:

1. **Purkinje cells** are inhibitory GABAergic interneurons which show a developed and large dendritic arbor. Their cell bodies are placed in the _intermediate layer_ of the cerebellar cortex, which is one cell thick.
2. **Granule cells** are excitatory glutamatergic neurons, with only four to five dendrites per neuron. These are the most common type of neurons in the cerebellum and brain by far (around 50 billions). Their cell bodies lie in the _innermost layer_ of the cerebellar cortex.

The cerebellum contains three types of axonal projections. Mossy and climbing fibers provides input into the cerebellum, whereas parallel fibers provide interneuron connectivity:

1. **Mossy fibers** originate in the _brainstem_. They make excitatory synapses to the cerebellar nuclei and granulate cells (hundreds per fiber).
2. **Climbing fibers** come from the _inferior olive_ exclusively. They make synapse with about ten Purkinje cells in around 300 different sites.
3. **Parallel fibers** originate in the _granulate cells_ and project into hundreds of Purkinje ones splitting in the _topmost cerebellar layer_, running parallel to the cerebellar folds, and perpendicular to the Purkinje’s dendritic arbor. This architecture greatly improves the mossy fiber’s power.

Finally, _inhibitory_ Purkinje cell’s axons synapse with the cerebellar nuclei, which are the sole route through wich signals leave the cerebellum (i.e. the most common signaling to cerebellar nuclei is inhibitory). Much rarer is the activation by _excitatory_ climbing fibers which produce long lasting effect changes in the excitability of the Purkinje cells, allowing for _motor learning_. Climibing fibers fire specifically when a desired motor outcome _does not_ correlate with the actual motor behavior, weakening the strength of such paths.
