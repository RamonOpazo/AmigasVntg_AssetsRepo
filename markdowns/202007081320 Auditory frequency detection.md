# Auditory frequency detection
#MCB80_3x #model #audition #discrimination

In order to separate the different frequencies that compose a particular sound, the inner ear is structured in a way that resembles a string, by changing the mechanical properties of the basilar membrane along the cochlea.

At the **base** of the cochlea the basilar membrane is _thin_ and _taut_. As one moves along the length of the cochlea, the basilar membrane gets increasingly _broad_ and _floppy_. Sound waves of high frequencies will resonate better the closer to the base of the cochlea, whereas sound waves of low frequencies will resonate better at the apex.

Because the frequency is a rate across space in the basilar membrane of the cochlea, we call this a **tonotopic** map (an analogous of the retinotopic map in the retina). The cells that sit on the basilar membrane are then sensitive to a specific frequency, a process named **place coding**. Finally, the activity level of neurons indicates the _intesity_ of the sound (its volume). The more the basilar membrane moves, the louder that specific frequency is perceived.

**Sensorineural hearing loss** (SNHL) is produced by the loss of function of the inner ear or the auditory nerve, caused by genetic and environmental damage. In some cases, it can be treated with a _cochlear implant_, which translate auditory signals directly to the auditory nerve, but with less accuracy than the biological structure.
