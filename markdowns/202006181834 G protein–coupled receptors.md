The most common type of metabotropic receptor are the **G protein–coupled recetors (GPCRs)**. This compose a large family of related transmembrane proteins which present remarkably similar features in their intracellular domain, but that also show a huge diversity of ligand–binding sites in the extracellular. This receptors are encoded in approximately 2000 genes, corresponding to 10% of the total human genome. The intracellular domain of a GPCR binds a set of three proteins called _alpha_, _beta_ and _gamma_. This are the G proteins, so named because they bind **guanosin triphospate (GTP)**.

The basic principle of GPCRs functioning are all the same: a _ligand binds_ to the extracellular portion of the GPCR, which produces a _change in the intracellular domain_. Such internal change can be, for example, the detachment of the alpha subunit which in turn can interact with other proteins, activating or inactivating them. Frequently, the activation is done on enzymes that produce **second messengers**.

Of particular importance in the neuron is **cyclic AMP (cAMP)**, a second messenger generated from ATP through the action of the **adenylyl cyclase** enzyme. This second messenger activates in turn another enzyme called **protein kinase A (PKA)**. Is this PKA which will finally activate a variety of other proteins, including ion channels. Changes in gene expression are also possible.
