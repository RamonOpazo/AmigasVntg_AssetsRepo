# Auditory system overview
#MCB80_3x #audition #neurophysiology #overview

The auditory system translate changes in _air pressure_ and _air density_ into brain activity. This changes are called **rarefaction waves** and travel through air and water. The speed of sound through air at sea level is in average 343 m/s. The form of the wave sound distinguish two properties of sound:

- **Volume**, which is determined by the _amplitude_ of the wave. The bigger the amplitude the louder.
- **Pitch**, which is the result in changes of the _frequency_ of the wave. The higher the frequency (the smaller the distance between to valleys) the higher the pitch.

Humans can hear in the _range of 20 to 20.000 Hz_. Human speech is confined to the _range of 200 to 2.000 Hz_, so hearing loss due to age does not affect it, normally.
