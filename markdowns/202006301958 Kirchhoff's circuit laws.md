Kirchhoff’s laws are two **equalities** that deal with **current** and **potential difference** (i.e. voltage) of electrical circuits.

The **first law**, also called Kirchhoff’s point or junction rule, states that the _algebraic sum_ of currents in a _network of conductors_ at a _point_ is _zero_.

$$
\displaystyle
\sum^{n}_{k=1} I_{k} = 0
$$

The **second law** states that the _algebraic sum_ of all the voltages around any _closed_ loop in a circuit is equal to _zero_. In other words, no energy is lost. This can be formalized as follows.

$$
\displaystyle
\sum^{n}_{k=1} V_{k} = 0
$$

In the following diagram, $v_{1} + v_{2} + v_{3} + v_{4} = 0$.
