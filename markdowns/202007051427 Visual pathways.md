Once information arrives at the visual cortex in V1, it spreads anteriorly to other structures in the cerebral cortex. There are two preferred pathways that information takes: _ventral_ and _dorsal_ pathways, which have specific functions regarding integration of visual information.

1. **Ventral pathway**. This pathway conveys the _what_ meaning to visual information. The pathway comprises the following areas: **V1 → V2 → V4 → inferior temporal cortex** (IT). Two characteristics are developed through this pathway:

    - **Receptive field**. The further into the pathway, the bigger the receptive field of the neuron. In V1 the receptive field takes into account small areas of the visual field. In later stages, the receptive field comprises almost complete areas of the visual field.
    - **Complexity**. The complexity of signals rises from simple integration of edges and changes in contrast in V1 to integration of visual concepts as faces or recognizable figures in IT.

2. **Dorsal pathway**. This pathway conveys the _where_ and _how_ visual information. It’s composed of the **middle temporal cortex** (MT) and the **posterior parietal area** (PPA):

    - **MT**. Its role is to detect direction and speed of movement.
    - **PPA**. Concerned to directing attention to particular parts of the visual field.

This two pathways have connection in between them, for example in V3. This allows for a more complex integration of different visual stimuli.

Lesions in all this areas produce different deficits:

- **Scotoma**. Happens when there are lesions in _V1_ and _V2_. Specifically in V1, the cortex is organized in a fashion called _retinotopy_ [§202007021655 ─ Primary visual cortex], so it maps the retinal input.
- **Visual agnosia**. Produced by lesions in _V4_, in which a whole class of visual information is no longer recognized. An example is _prosopagnosia_, or the inability to recognize faces.
- **Akinetopsia**. Is the inability to recognize movement, so the patient perceives the world as a series of still images instead of a fluid motion picture. This type of malfunction is produced by lesions in _MT_.
- **Visual neglect** and **simultagnosia**. Lesions in _PPA_ produce a neglect of part of the visual field. In these cases the visual information exist, but it is neglected by the organism. Simultagnosia occurs when PPA is mostly damaged, which in turn affect most of the visual field. In this last example, the organism is unaware of the visual information that receives. _Bálint’s syndorme_ is an extreme form of simultagnosia which comes paired with _oculomotor apraxia_ and _optic ataxia_.
