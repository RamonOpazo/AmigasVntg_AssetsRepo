## Overview
HarvardX course (XSeries edX Program) on the fundamentals of neuroscience. I took this course on 3th June 2020 to advance my resume. Due to the high quality of the course I payed for the certification on 8th June. The course is divided into three parts:

1. The electrical properties of the neuron.
2. Neurons and networks.
3. The brain.
