# Gustatory receptors

The gustatory receptors allow the identification of certain types of molecules in the mouth, which in turn conveys information about nutrition and potential damage. On the surface of the tongue these _taste receptors_ are bundled together into _taste buds_, which in turn are packed into _taste papillae_. The sense of taste is a combination of the perception through the taste receptors, the temperature, pain (like in the case of hot sauce) and aroma.

Taste receptors are _equally distributed_ on the surface of the tongue. Out of the taste receptors, there are distinct families that permit the distinction between stimuli, in a broader sense compared to the four plus one classic flavor categories.

1. **Ionotropic receptors**. These type of receptors activate by specific stimuli: _sodium_ in **salty**, and _protons_ in sour taste. In both cases it is produced a positive ion influx with a subsequent depolarization, wich in turn determines the release of neurotransmitters and activation of gustatory fibers. Some _sour_ receptors express an enzyme called _carbonic anhydrase_ which catalyses _carbon dioxide_ and water into bicarbonate and _protons_. These protons activate the receptor, thus allowing for the taste of **carbonation**.
2. **GPCRs for fatty acids**. Two specific GPCRs, _GPR40_ and _GPR120_ activate in the presence of fatty acids.
3. **PPK28**. A receptor that depolarize cells in the presence of pure water. This receptor has been identified in flies so far.
4. **GPCRs for bitter, umami and sweet**. Two interrelated families has been found, **T1R**, with a large N-terminal domain, and **T2R**, which present a shorter N-terminal domain. These receptors are expressed exclusively, so one can found either of them or none of them, but never both of them in the same cell. So far, three subtypes of T1Rs have been identified: _T1R1, T1R2 and T1R3_. When present in combination _T1R1 and T1R3_, the cell is depolarized in the presence of **umami**. In the case of _T1R2 and T1R3_, the cell responds to sweet compounds. In contrast, more than 40 subtypes of T2R has been found, allowing for a the detection of specific **bitter** compounds, like in the case of _T2R10_, which respond in the presence of strychnine.

The **encoding** of taste happens in the **taste receptor cells** and not in the receptor itself. Note that the taste receptor cells _are not_ neurons. This was confirmed using transgenic mice. It was observed that, for example, knocking out bitter receptors in a mouse and then expressing them on cells with sweet receptors, the mouse will consume bitter compounds like crazy. This means that the cell still encodes for sweet (i.e. liked compounds), but will respond to bitters because it can only be activated by this type of compounds.
