# Localization of sound

In order to understand sound localization one have to take into account a couple of characteristics of the auditory system:

- The head acts as a barrier producing a **sound shadow** for the ear located contralaterally to the sound source.
- The time difference of sound perception of both ears, determined by the speed of sound, is approximately 1 ms. This difference is called **interaural time difference (ITD)**.
- The difference in perceived intensity between both ears, determined by the sound shadow created by the head and other obstacles, as well as the attenuation of sound because of distance of source, is called **interaural level difference (ILD)**.
- The **end bulb of Held**, a specially large synapse that promote fast and efficient information transfer between the cochlear nucleus and the superior olive, providing a basis for ILD.
- The **shape of the pinnae** is asymmetrical in the anteroposterior and superoinferior axes. This allow for pitch and timing difference detection which in turn allow localization of sound.

In the case of _lateralization_, some neurons of the auditory system are disposed in such a fashion that act as **coincidence detectors** for inputs coming from both ears. This is in part achieved by the time it takes the signal to travel down the axon to spatially distributed synapses.

Finally, there is a relation between the auditory and visual systems. Not only is the visual system able to help the auditory one make sense of the direction of a sound source, but also it can **override** it. For example, in the case of ventriloquism, the sound is located as coming from the doll rather than the mouth of the ventriloquist.
