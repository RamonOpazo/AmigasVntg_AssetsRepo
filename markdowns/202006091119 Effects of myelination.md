# Effects of myelination

Myelinated axons are faster than their unmyelinated counterparts. There are two reason for this to happen, higher membrane resistance and lower membrane capacitance.

A myelinated axon shows a **higher membrane resistance** due to the fact that any leakage and voltage-gated ion channels that happen to be placed under the myelin sheath will not be in contact with the external medium, and so, there will be no possible ion efflux. This, in turn, will produce an extension on the _length constant_ of that axon (and due to the next characteristic a faster potential transmission).

In the other hand, **lower capacitance** is due to the increase in distance between the parallel-plate parts of the membrane capacitor system which, in turn, shortens the _time constant_ of the membrane, speeding up the action potential.
