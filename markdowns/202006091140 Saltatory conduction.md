Myelinated axons conduct current more efficiently and faster than unmyelinated ones, as explained by their higher membrane resistance and lower capacitance. Nevertheless, a completely myelinated axon is not physiologically feasible due to the fact that the signal would decay completely in such an scenario (because of the length constant). In turn, nature provides a clever solution: partial insulation.

Axons are partially insulated by the glia, leaving tiny spaces without insulation in between the sheathed parts called _Nodes of Ranvier_. Now, the signal travels fast through the myelinated part of the axon taking advantage of the high membrane resistance and lower capacitance. The signal decays but is still strong enough to surpass the membrane's threshold in order to fire a new _regenerated_ action potential at the next Node of Ranvier.

If the myelin sheath is damaged at some point in the axon (partial damage), the consequent length constant diminishes so much that the signal stops completely and cannot be regenerated.
