Glutamic acid is the _ionized form_ of glutamate. Glutamate receptors are the most common excitatory receptors of the central nervous system (CNS) and can be either ionotropic as well as metabotropic. An explanation of either one is given.

The **ionotropic glutamate receptor** is a family of receptors all of which bind glutamate _plus some other more selective molecule_. The two most studied ones are AMPA and NMDA receptors.

1. **AMPA receptors** bind selectively to **α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid** and act as a promiscuous cation channel in the postsynaptic membrane. This is the most commonly found receptor of the central nervous system.
2. **NMDA receptors** bind selectively to **$N$–methyl–D–aspartate** also acting as promiscuous cation channels, though the influx of $Ca^{+2}$ is related to its function. They are involved in many cognitive functions such as synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. NMDA receptors are not exclusively ligand gated, but they also need a second activation by voltage. The central pore of this receptors contain a $Mg^{+2}$ that blocks the channel and that is only removed in the presence of a depolarized membrane. For this reason (the need of both the ligand and voltage stimulation) they are often called **coincidence detectors**.

The **metabotropic glutamate receptor** is a large family of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate specific signal transduction pathways in the cell. Their action is slower compared to the ionotropic receptors, but the effect is long lasting.
