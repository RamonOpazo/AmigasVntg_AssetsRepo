Changes in membrane potential cause transmission of a charge down the cell. This charge cannot travel far before dissipating part of its energy, a process that depends on the **membrane's and axonal resistances**. These resistances relate to the travel distance of the charge as follow:

1. **Direct relation to membrane's resistance**. The less resistance, the more likely ions can escape out of the cell, thus reducing the charge being transmitted. On the contrary, a greater membrane's resistance will prevent the escape of ions and the overall extension of the distance traveled by the charge.
2. **Inverse relation to axonal's resistance**. A greater resistance on the axon itself will reduce the travel distance of charges. In the inverse case the travel distance will extend.

The equation that describe this relationship is the **lenght constant equation**. This equation gives the distance at which the charge has dropped to a ~37% of the original change in potential.

$$
\displaystyle \lambda = \sqrt{\frac{R_{membrane}}{R_{axial}}}
$$

> where $\lambda$ is the length constant in millimeters, $R_{membrane}$ is the membrane's resistance in $\Omega*cm$, and $R_{axial}$ is the axonal resistance in $\Omega/cm$.

The length constant is a passive property of the membrane due to the fact that is independent of the functioning of voltage-gated ion channels or pumps; in fact, it is an intrinsic property of the cell's membrane.
