Once the the auditory signal leaves the thalamus it radiates to the cerebral cortex to an area named the **auditory cortex**, which is located in both temporal lobes of the brain, roughly near **Brodmann areas 41 and 42** [§202007091430 ─ Brodmann areas of the cortex]. This auditory cortex organizes much like the visual cortex, starting at **A1**.

A1 is organized in layers, whereas **layer 1** contains few cell bodies, **layers 2 and 3** mostly contains small to medium–sized pyramidal cells. **Layer 4** is packed with granule cells and receives inputs from MGM. **Layers 5 and 6** contain large pyramidal cells. A1 is also _tonotopically_ organized, where _low frequencies_ are analyzed at the _rostral and lateral ends_ of the area, and _high frequencies_ at the _caudal and medial ends_.

Neurons of A1 are respond to specific _receptive fields_ which grow in complexity. There are receptive fields for frequency ranges, temporal patterns, intensity, types of sound and localization, among others. Some auditory cortex neurons respond to input from one ear, whereas others respond to input from both ears.

Other important area of the auditory cortex is **A2**. Neurons in this area respond particularly well to phonemes.

Finally, the auditory cortex is organized _bilaterally_ which gives the system some resilience to damage. A _unilateral_ damage thus leads to slight hearing loss. In the other hand, _bilateral_ lesions lead to cortical deafness. In this way the auditory system differs from the visual one, where in the latter unilateral damage produce total cortical blindness in one visual hemifield.
