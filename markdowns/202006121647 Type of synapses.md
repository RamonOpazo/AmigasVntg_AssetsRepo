# Type of synapses

Two types of synapses are found in mammals: electric and chemical synapses. Though both allow for the transmission of signaling between neurons, they are different in functionality and relative advantages.

1. **Electric synapses** are the less common type of synapses in mammals, and abound mostly in parts of the nervous system where speed is of utmost importance, like in reflex circuits. This type of synapses allow for signaling  bidirectionality, and are very fast compared to their chemical counterpart.
2. **Chemical synapses** are very common and allow for a more diversified signaling capability. In this type of synapses the signal arrives at the terminal part of the axon of the _presynaptic neuron_ and induce the release of chemicals, either neurotransmitters or neuromodulators, which in turn travel by _diffusion_ through the space between the neurons to receptors on the membrane of the dendrites of the _postsynaptic neuron_. This space is called the _synaptic cleft_. Chemical synapses are slower than the electrical ones, but they allow for diversity of signaling and unidirectionality.

Not only are the chemicals released to the cleft diverse, thus, allowing for a gamut of responses to their signaling, but the receptors of the postsynaptic neuron are also varied. Some receptors, called **ionotropic receptors**, are ion channels that allow for depolarization of the membrane. Other receptors, called **metabotropic receptors**, can signal changes in the expression of genes of the postsynaptic neuron. Neurotransmitters bind to the former type, while neuromodulators bind to the latter.
