Only the _retinal ganglion_ cells produce _action potentials_ in the retina (with the exception of some amacrine cells). The rest of the cells in the retina respond to stimulation with _graded changes_ in their membrane potential. Due to this fact, the knowledge of retinal ganglion cells far precedes the knowledge of the rest of the system.

Retinal ganglion cells receive synapses from several interneurons in the retina. A single ganglion cell shows a response that is determined by the stimulus on the retina, called **receptive field**. Ganglion cells have a **center–surround** receptive field. Whereas some ganglion cells have an **on–center off--surround** receptive field, others have and **off–center on–surround** one. This organization allows the retinal ganglion cell to have a high sensitivity to _edges and contrast_ of images.

A more formal definition of receptive field is: a portion of sensory space that can elicit neuronal responses when stimulated. The receptive field can be from one to multidimensional. The response can be defined as firing rate as well as subthreshold activity.

Is important to notice that **photoreceptors** have _center–only_ receptive fields, whereas **retinal ganglions** have a _center–surround_ one (previously described). Another difference arises from the convergence of synapses to the retinal ganglion cell, which allows it to respond to a bigger receptive field compared to the very focal and tiny one of the photoreceptors.
