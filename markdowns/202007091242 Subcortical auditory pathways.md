# Subcortical auditory pathways
#MCB80_3x #model #neuralnetwork #audition

The tonotopical signal leaving the cochlea through the **cochlear nerve** radiates into subcortical structures with tonotopic mappings forming pathways up to the cortex.

The first subcortical structure that is reached is found in the _brainstem_, named the **cochlear nuclei**. There are two cochlear nuclei, the **ventral cochlear nucleus** send signals to another structure called the **superior olive** both _ipsi–_ and _contralateral_. The superior olive is then the first station where signal from both ears are processed together. It function is to: _a)_ encode differences in sound intensity, and _b)_ encode timing differences between the sounds perceived by both ears.

From the _superior olive_, auditory information is sent to the _ipsilateral_ **inferior colliculus** in the _midbrain_. This structure also receives auditory signals coming from the _contralateral_ **dorsal cochlear nucleus**. The inferior colliculi sits below the superior colliculi, also known as the **optic tectum**, thus explaining its function, that is, _directing and orientating head and eye movement_ in response to an auditory stimulus (the superior colliculum does the same in response to visual stimulus).

Finally, before reaching the cortex, the audotory signal is sent from the _inferior colliculus_ to the **medial geniculate nucleus (MGM)**, a _thalamic_ structure which function is to allow the organism to _direct and maintain attention to a particular sound_.
