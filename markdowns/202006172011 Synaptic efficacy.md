Signaling in the presynaptic terminal produce changes in the dendrites and soma of the postsynaptic neuron that affects the likelihood of firing an action potential at the axon hillock. **Synaptic efficacy** is the capacity of a presynaptic input to influence postsynaptic output. The parameters that characterize this situation are as follow:

1. **Synaptic distance and efficacy**. The longer the distance an EPSP travels to reach the axon hillock, the more attenuated the signal becomes. This is explained by the length constant which is affected in two ways: farther away EPSPs have to _travel more length constants_ to reach the axon hillock which produces a decay on the signal; and far away synapses occur in general in thinner parts of the dendrites which present a _higher axial resistance_ which shortens the length constant. In other words, given equal amplitude of signals, farther away synapses (from the axon hillock) will attenuate more than closer ones.
2. **Synaptic summation**. Given two equally distant synapses (assuming identical dendritic factors), signals coming from both synapses at the same time will register a higher EPSP than coming from each synapse alone. Nevertheless, the summation effect will be non–linear due to the effect of three components: a) _driving force_ is reduced due to diminishing returns of reversal potential, which means that the driving force of a given ion will diminish the closer to the reversal potential the membrane is; b) _dendritic action potentials_ are possible due to the existence of voltage–gated ion channels which affects incoming signals in unpredictable ways furthering the nonlinearity of the driving force; and c) _action potential backpropagation_ from the axon hillock back into the dendritic arbor.
3. **Synaptic inhibition**. Placement of inhibitory synapses modulates the membrane potential registered at the axon hillock. Inhibitory synapses can be placed not only at dendrite stems, but also can appear in the soma of the neuron and even prior to the axon hillock. For an inhibitory synapse to have an effect suppressing EPSPs it _must be placed between the excitatory synapse and the axon hillock_. Also, inhibitory synapses placed closer to the hillock and in the soma can suppress more excitatory synapses than the ones placed at dendrite stems. The membrane potential hardly registers a change when an inhibitory signal is produced due to the fact that $Cl^{-}$ influx into the cell has a Nernst potential (-65 mV) that is very close to the resting potential of the neuron (-70 mV). Synaptic inhibition contributes to the nonlinearity of excitatory synapses.
4. **Synaptic temporal summation**. Two stimuli coming from the same synapse in close succession have a summation effect on the EPSP showing a larger amplitude and different shape than in single stimulations.
5. **Synaptic temporal inhibition**. Inhibitory inputs accelerate the falling phase of excitatory inputs. In other words, inhibitory inputs destroy excitatory temporal summation.
