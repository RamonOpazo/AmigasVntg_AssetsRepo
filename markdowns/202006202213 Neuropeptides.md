Neuropeptides are a large family of neuromodulators, around 5 to 20 amino acids in length, all of which have in common that their _only receptor are GCPRs_. They typically derive from the cleavage of larger precursor proteins that are produced by the cells in the body, and then transported to their site of action (a nerve terminal) where thy are cut into smaller pieces.

So far, around a 100 different neuropeptides have been identified, though their number is probably much larger. Examples include: _hypocretin_, which regulates sleep; _leptin_, involved in appetite regulation; _substance–P_, which modulate pain sensation.

Opioids are a family of neuropeptides that regulate pain perception. They include exogenous as well as endogenous substances. The opioid receptors are named: delta, mu, kappa and nociceptin. _Endogenous opioids_ include: enkephalins, endorphin and dynorphin. _Exogenous opioids_ include: morphine and codeine, which are present in the poppy flower derived opium. _Synthetic opioids_ include: hydrocodone, oxycodone and oxycontin.

Heroin (diacethylmorphine) is derived from morphine with two acethyl groups attached. It is metabolized by the sequential removal of these acetyl groups in the O–3 and O–6 position.
