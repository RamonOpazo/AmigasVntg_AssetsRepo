Voltage–gated ion channels open or close depending on the voltage of the membrane and two factors that modulate their behavior:

1. **Probability**. Channels have a higher probability to be in one state or the other when exposed to a given potential. This means that not all the channels of a given species will be open if the opening condition is met. The same happens when in the closing condition, where not all the channels of the species will be closed. The condition defines a _probability for a certain state to happen_, but is not absolute.
2. **Kinetics**. This term refers to the _probabilistic temporal dynamic of a given channel to change state_. For example, the voltage–gated $Na^+$ channels have a faster kinetic than the $K^+$ ones, and so the former open and close faster than the latter.

Some channels have a third state. For example, the voltage–gated $Na^+$ channels can be in an open, closed and inactivated state. Whereas the open and closed states refers to the internal geometry of the channel, the inactivated state refers to the external geometry in which part of the channel covers the exit of itself. All this conformational states have different kinetics.

Finally, the _inactivated state_ of the voltage–gated $Na^+$ channels and the slow kinetics of the $K^+$ ones explain the **refractory period** of the action potential. This period have two phases:

1. **Absolute refractory period**. Mediated by the inactivation of the $Na^+$ channels. As long they are inactivated there will be no mean to allow for their functioning. Again, the inactivated state occurs disregarding the open or closed state, and so, determines an inability of the channel to allow the passage of ions.
2. **Relative refractory period**. Mediated by the hyperpolarization of the membrane due to the slow kinetics of the $K^+$ channels (they remain open for a time after repolarization). During this period a bigger than normal stimulus can produce a new action potential.
