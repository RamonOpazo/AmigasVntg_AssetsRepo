# Synaptic plasticity

The brain is capable of manifesting complex behaviors in adaptation to changes in the ambient, changes that would take thousand of years for evolution to adapt. In response to this ever changing situation, the brain favors some synapses and attenuate or even terminate others, a process called **synaptic plasticity**. This process can be further subdivided as a function of time:

1. **Short–term plasticity** is the process of synaptic adaptation that acts on a timescale of millisecond to minutes. There are two possible types of short–term plasticity mechanisms:
    
    - _Short–term synaptic strengthening_, also called _synaptic enhancement_, produces an increase in EPSPs in the postsynaptic terminal. This process is called _synaptic facilitation_.
    - _Short–term synaptic weakening_, also called _synaptic depression_, attributed to several causes: a) depletion of presynaptic vesicles upon repeating firing, b) postsynaptic processes, and c) feedback activation of presynaptic receptors.

2. **Long–term plasticity** lasts from minutes to hours or even longer, allowing learning. There are two processes involved:

    - _Long–term potentiation_ (LTP), making synapses stronger.
    - _Long–term depression_ (LTD), which makes them weaker.
