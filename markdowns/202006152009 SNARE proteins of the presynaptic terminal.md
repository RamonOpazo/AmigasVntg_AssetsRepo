SNAREs are a group of highly conserved proteins both in structure and function across different organisms, involved in the fusion of vesicles to the membrane. Their name comes from **SNAP REceptor**. SNAPs are **soluble NSF attachment proteins**, involved in membrane fusion binding to their SNARE counterpart and recruit the **ATPase NSF** (_N_–ethylmaleilmide–sensitive factor). NSF provides the energy to untangle the SNARE complex, allowing it to be recycled for future fusion events.

There are two type of SNARE proteins: vesicle associated **v-SNARE** proteins and target **t-SNARE** proteins found in the terminal membrane. Another newer classification takes into account the structural properties of these proteins dividing them according to the residue they present to the _zero ionic layer_ (the main site of interaction in the core of SNARE proteins): **R-SNAREs** present an _arginine_ (R) residue and frequently act as _v-SNAREs_. **Q-SNAREs** present a _glutamine_ (Q) residue and act as _t-SNAREs_.

The main v-SNARE is called **synaptobrevin**, a member of the **vesicle–associated membrane protein (VAMP)** family of SNARE proteins. In the membrane, the main t-SNAREs are **SNAP–25** and **syntaxin**. The action potential activates voltage–gated calcium channels in the presynaptic membrane, producing an influx of $Ca^{+2}$ ions into the cell. This ions produce a conformational change in another protein called **synaptotagmin**, exposing binding sites for both synaptobrevin and syntaxin, thus producing the binding of vesicles at the terminal membrane necessary for the release of neurotransmitters.

The **botulinum toxin** cleaves SNARE proteins causing their inactivation, specifically, the release of _acethylcholine_ in excitatory synapses of the neuromuscular junction causing hypotonia and even total loss of motor function. In the other hand, **tetanus toxin** (which has a very similar structure to botulinum toxin) produces inactivation of inhibitory synapses, thus causing muscle spasm.
