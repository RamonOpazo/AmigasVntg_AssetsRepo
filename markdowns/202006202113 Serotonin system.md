# Serotonin system
#MCB80_2x #neurophysiology #receptors #model

The serotonergic system is the most important neuromodulatory system in the brain. Its _effects include calm, content and sleepy states_. This neurotransmitter is released in the _dorsal raphe nucleus_ of the brain. Serotonin receptors are found in many parts of the brain, including hippocampus, neocortex, thalamus, amygdala and spinal cord. Serotonin is mostly found outside the central nervous system, in the cells of the gut.

Serotonin is a metabolite of the amino acid _tryptophan_. Tryptophan is converted into 5–hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and then into _5–hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)_, also called serotonin.

Due to its effects in the brain, the serotonergic system has been the target of many therapies to treat depression, which include:

1. **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)**. The enzyme monoamine oxidase breaks down serotonin, thus, inhibitors of this enzyme prolong the action of serotonin. MAIOs can inhibit other enzymatic pathways not related with serotonin.
2. **Tricyclic antidepressants**. They target the reuptake of serotonin in the synapse, thus prolonging its effect. Tricyclic antidepressants also present off–target effects and can act as sodium and calcium channel blockers.
3. **Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**. Like fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft). They present a higher specificity for site of action, inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin in the synaptic cleft.
