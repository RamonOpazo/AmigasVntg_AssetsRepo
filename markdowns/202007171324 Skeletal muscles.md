# Skeletal muscles

There are three type of muscles: voluntary _skeletal_ attached to bones, involuntary _smooth_ which control internal organs, and involuntary _cardiac_ that gives the heart its function.

**Skeletal muscles** are striated (thus the alternative name striated muscles) due to the disposition of **mysoin** and **actin** in bands called **sarcomeres**. These sarcomeres are the _functional unit_ of the skeletal muscles. Myosin moves across actin in the direction of the muscle fiber, called **myofibril**. Consecutive complexes of actine and myosine are stacked along the perpendicular axis of the myofibril, and are attached to other sarcomeres through the **z-disk**.

Skeletal muscles cells are **multinucleic**, a condition determined by their origin as several cells that fuse to form a unified structure. Several multinucleic skeletal muscle cells are held together by networks of connective tissue.

Finally, there are _three major_ motor systems which occur by different streams:

- **Axial muscles**, which control the center of the body.
- **Proximal muscles**, controlling the proximal part of the extremities and those closer to the center of the body like chest and upper arms.
- **Distal muscles**, which are the farthest from the center, for example, the fingers, etc.

Aside from this groups, there exist the **facial muscles** which are directly innervated by the brain through the seventh pair of cranial nerves.
