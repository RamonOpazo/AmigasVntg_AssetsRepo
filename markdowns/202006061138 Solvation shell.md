A **solvation shell** is the configuration of water molecules around a given ion. Due to the fact that water molecules are dipoles, they arrange around ions showing the opposite charged pole to the ion (e.g. with the oxygen pole looking inside around a $K^{+}$ ion). This configuration is unique and happens on the lowest energy level possible.

Ion channels form a space inside them that resembles the solvation shell of a given ion, due to the specific positioning of it amino acids. This configuration thus allows for the _selective_ passage of specific ions because of favorable energetic conditions needed to fit in them.

For this reason, ion channels are specific to _size_ and _charge_ of ions. Both conditions must be present for a given ion to be granted passage through them. It is important to notice that ions will flow through ion channels _only_ if there is a favorable concentration gradient (down the concentration gradient). Ion channels are _passive_ in this regard, and so they are also called **leakage channels**.
