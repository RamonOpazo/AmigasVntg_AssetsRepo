Neural network _efficacy_ is defined by the **structural** properties of the synapses involved, like the type of input, either excitatory or inhibitory, the distance between synapse and the axon hillock, the shape of the dendritic arbor, etc. Nevertheless, there are **non–structural** characteristics than can also produce a change in synaptic efficacy, a process called **neuromodulation**.

Neuromodulation happens because of a third neuron involved, neuron that modulates the efficacy of the synapses they interact with. This modulation can happen a) **presynaptically**, for example, altering the amount of neurotransmitter released by the presynaptic terminal; b) **postsynaptically**, altering the response of the postsynaptic terminal to a given neurotransmitter; or c) these mechanisms can also act **together**.

The neuromodulator signaling can be achieved either by ionotropic as well as metabotropic receptors, the latter being the most common type. The range of different types of neuromodulation is greater in the postsynaptic neuron rather than in the presynaptic one.
