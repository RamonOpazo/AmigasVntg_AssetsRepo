# Cellular membrane driving force
#MCB80_1x #neurophysiology #membranePotential #equation

The driving force is the measure for a given ion of how difficult it is to push it through the cell's membrane.

$$
\displaystyle E_{driving force} = E_{membrane} - E_{ion}
$$

> where $E_{membrane}$ is the total potential of the membrane, and $E_{ion}$ is the Nernst potential of the given ion.

The driving force is directly proportional to its constituents, and so, one can think of ions always independently trying to approach the Nernst potential.

As an example let's take the Nernst potential of $Ca^{++}$ $(\sim + 120\ mV)$, $K^{+}$ $(\sim - 80\ mV)$, and the resting potential of a neuron $(\sim - 70\ mV)$. The driving force of calcium is, thus, around $- 190\ mV$, compared to the lesser $+ 10\ mV$ of the potassium.
