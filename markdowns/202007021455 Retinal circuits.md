There are several neuronal circuits in the retina:

- **Direct pathway**. The most _simple_ one, formed by an input photoreceptor through a bipolar cell to an output retinal ganglion cell.
- **Lateral pathway**. At each synapse in the direct pathway, the neuronal connections are modulated by lateral connections of horizontal and amacrine cells.

The main neurotransmitter of photoreceptors is **glutamate**, which is released in the dark when the photoreceptor depolarizes [§202006292034 ─ Phototransduction]. So, when stimulated (that is, when dark), the photoreceptor sends a signal than travel through either the direct and the lateral pathways.

In the **direct pathway**, the bipolar cells can be classified as either _on_ or _off_ bipolar cells. **Off bipolar cells** glutamate–gated channels produce an EPSP on the cell’s membrane through sodium influx. **On bipolar cells** glutamate GPCRs produce an hyperpolarization of the cell’s membrane. Each bipolar cell receives synapses from:

- A cluster of direct photoreceptors
- Horizontal cells that connect to a ring of photoreceptors further away from the direct cluster.

This organization produce a **receptive field** [§202007021438 ─ Retinal processing] with a central and surrounding area. The response to the surround area is in general the opposite as the central one. This response is then passed to the output retinal ganglion cell.

In the **lateral pathway**, amacrine cells integrate the input of cones and rods in the retinal ganglion cell.

Some retinal ganglion cells have response to other type of integrated stimuli, for instance: particular color, movement of light patterns, etc.
