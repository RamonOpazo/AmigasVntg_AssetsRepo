The Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz flux equation (GHK equation) describes the membrane potential in its **steady state**, that is, the state in which the charge of the membrane does not change (i.e. there is no net _charge_ flow due to _charge equilibrium_). The steady state is not exactly the same as **equilibrium state**, in which the net flow of _ions_ is zero due to _equilibrium reached at their Nernst potentials_. So, in an equilibrium state there is no net ion flow, whereas in the steady state ions could still be moving in and out of the cell, but the net charge of the membrane remains the same. The resting potential is an example of steady state.

$$
\displaystyle Vm = \frac{RT}{F} ln \left( \frac{p_{K}[K]_{e} + p_{Na}[Na]_{e} + p_{Cl}[Cl]_{i}}{p_{K}[K]_{i} + p_{Na}[Na]_{i} + p_{Cl}[Cl]_{e}} \right)
$$

> for $T$ in Kelvin, $R = 8.314\ J/K*mol$ (universal gas constant), and $F = 96,485\ C/mol$ (Faraday's constant).
> $p_{ion}$ corresponds to the permeability of an ion.

The equation is affected by two factors:

1. The concentration of particular ions inside and outside the cell.
2. The permeability of the membrane to a given ion.

Changes in **permeability** have a dramatic effect on charge changes, thus, affecting the GHK equation more than the relative concentration of the ions. This can be seen in the equation; every ion concentration is multiplied by its permeability. If permeability is, for example, zero, the concentration becomes meaningless.

For this reason, the cell controls the membrane potential with changes on the permeability of ions rather than on the concentration of ions. By this mean the cell takes advantage of the already created diffusion $\Delta$ and electrostatic force.
