# Dopamine system
#MCB80_2x #neurophysiology #receptors #model

Although dopamine is secreted by some hundred thousand neurons, it projects over almost the entire brain. The three major functions of dopamine are: _movement regulation_, _reward behavior_ and _reinforcement learning_.

The major divisions of the dopamine system are called **pathways**. This includes: a) Mesocortical pathway, b) Mesolymbic pathway, c) Nigrostriatal pathway, and d) Tuberoinfundibular pathway. Dopamine neurons originating in the **substantia nigra** are involved in _movement regulation_. They become damaged in Parkinson's disease, thus dropping the levels of dopamine. Treatment includes the administration of levodopa (L-DOPA).

Dopaminergic neurons from the **ventral tegmental area** project to many other areas of the brain, and are involved in _reward behavior_. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, producing an increased likelihood of inserting a postsynaptic action.
